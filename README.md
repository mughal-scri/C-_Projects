**As A Programming Enthusiast, I'm always eager to learn new thing about the programming although I'm just at beginning stage!**
The attachments are the codes in the flow in which I'm learning things 
Well, As I said I'm on my beginning stage, I don't know much about the programming 
Whenever I Find out about a new concept, I just write it down somewhere ASAP and look for their practicality
Where they can be used practically and how I implement them in different scenarios
Plus, By the time after 2025, you find this repository, means I was learing **Fundamentals of Programming**
Make sure to check out some of the codes that I had done personally 
plus I'm working on a end semester project in which I'm  building console based shopping system and the Inventory management system. **Like Online Store But console based**
I'll make sure that it'll will be uploaded when its done
